This will confirm the assumption that there is a high population of residents over 21.\n- Foursquare location data to identify how many breweries are in a given area. Venue location data will be used to identify \"Breweries\" within Somerville.\n- Somerville will be distributed by Zip Code, which there are three zip codes in the city. The zip codes will be transformed into a dataframe. The list of zip codes has been retrieved from https://www.americantowns.com/somerville-ma/zip-code/"
